# Queuing-Theory-Application-for-Optimisation-in-Banking-Services
<p align= "justify"> In this case-study, we have considered a branch of a well known bank. The customer arrival is taken as a Poisson Distribution with arrival rate (λ) 40 customers per hour. The service time is distributed exponentially with mean 5 minutes per service. We consider that there is no forced balking i.e. the length of the queue is infinite. In order to represent this problem in terms of queuing theory, we will use <strong>M/M/c: ∞/∞/FCFS queuing model </strong>. The ‘M’ in queuing model represents the Markovian property.</p>

We are given the cost of per unit service per unit time (cs) as Rs 70 per hour. The waiting cost of per unit time per waiting customer (cw) as Rs 15 per customer. Let x represent the service level, the cost model can be expressed as:
**<p align="center"> ETC(x) = EOC(x) + EWC(x) </p>** where,   	
* ETC = Expected total cost per unit time
* EOC = Expected cost of operating the facility per unit time (cs µ c)
* EWC = Expected cost of waiting per unit time (cw Ls)

**Objectives of this study:**
* To study the impact of number of queues on the various parameters of queuing model and customer experience.
* To study the impact and find the optimal number of servers based on the cost model.
* To find the optimal service rate at which the service should be provided to improve the efficiency.
